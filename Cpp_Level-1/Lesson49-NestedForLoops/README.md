# Lesson 49: Nested For Loops

## Overview
This lesson demonstrates the use of nested for loops in C++. Each file contains examples showcasing different applications of nested loops.

### File Description
The files in this directory use nested loops to form various shapes and patterns created with letters, stars, and numbers, which are printed to the output. These examples illustrate how nested loops can generate complex designs and arrangements.

1. **[H1.cpp](./H1.cpp)**
2. **[H2.cpp](./H2.cpp)**
3. **[H3.cpp](./H3.cpp)**
4. **[H4.cpp](./H4.cpp)**
5. **[H5.cpp](./H5.cpp)**
6. **[H6.cpp](./H6.cpp)**

## How to Use
- Review each file to understand the various implementations of nested loops.
- Modify the code to see different outputs and strengthen your understanding.

## Notes
This lesson is intended to enhance your C++ skills by focusing on nested loop structures. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
