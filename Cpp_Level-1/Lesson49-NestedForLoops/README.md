# Lesson 49: Nested For Loops

## Overview
This lesson demonstrates the use of nested for loops in C++. Each file contains examples showcasing different applications of nested loops.

### File Descriptions
1. **[H1.cpp](./H1.cpp)**: Example demonstrating a simple nested loop structure.
2. **[H2.cpp](./H2.cpp)**: Illustrates the use of nested loops to create patterns.
3. **[H3.cpp](./H3.cpp)**: Showcases nested loops for multi-dimensional array traversal.
4. **[H4.cpp](./H4.cpp)**: Provides an example of using nested loops for generating tables.
5. **[H5.cpp](./H5.cpp)**: Explains nested loops with complex conditions.
6. **[H6.cpp](./H6.cpp)**: A final example to reinforce understanding of nested loops.

## How to Use
- Review each file to understand the various implementations of nested loops.
- Modify the code to see different outputs and strengthen your understanding.

## Notes
This lesson is intended to enhance your C++ skills by focusing on nested loop structures. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
