# Lesson 16 - Literals and Escape Sequences

## Overview
This directory contains exercises focused on literals and escape sequences in C++. The files include various examples that illustrate how to use different types of literals and special character sequences in string output.

## File Descriptions

1. **[H1.cpp](./H1.cpp)**: Demonstrates the use of the alert escape sequence `\a` to produce a sound alert.
2. **[H2.cpp](./H2.cpp)**: Illustrates the newline escape sequence `\n` for formatting output on new lines.
3. **[H3.cpp](./H3.cpp)**: Shows examples of the tab escape sequence `\t` for adding horizontal space in output.
